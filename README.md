# mysides #

A simple CLI tool for Finder sidebar modification.

**NOTE**: I clobbered this together with very little experience in C/CoreFoundation, as a result the code may be horrible.

**NOTE*: Using Versions 10.11 El Capitan or 10.12 Sierra, you can also use `sfltool` to achieve similar things. _These options were removed in 10.13 High Sierra onwards [*][1013-regression]._ Example:

    $ sfltool add-item com.apple.LSSharedFileList.FavoriteItems file:///Path/To/Sidebar/Folder

## Installing ##

The easiest option is to install via Homebrew Casks:

    brew cask install mysides

If you prefer not to use Homebrew, you can also download and run the prebuilt package in the [Releases tab]

## Usage ##

List sidebar favorites items:

    mysides list

Append a new item to the end of a list:

    mysides add example file:///Users/Shared/example

Insert a new item at the start of the list:

    mysides insert example file:///Users/Shared/example

Remove the item (by name):

    mysides remove example
